#### Node grpc calculator app
This is a mini proof of concept app I developed while learning integrating grpc with nodejs
- It has a service called `calculator` that computes inputs
- It exposes two methods `add` and `multiply` that perform adding and multiplication of any number of inputs passed to them ðŸ˜ƒ

##### How to reproduce ðŸ˜‰
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HizkiasAbraham/node-grpc-calculator.git
    cd node-grpc-calculator
    npm install
```
##### Demo

- Invalid input

- Addition input

- multiplication input
